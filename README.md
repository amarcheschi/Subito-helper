Subito helper is a (not even mvp) script that helps you track price changes and new elements on the popular italian marketplace "subito.it"

as of v 0.2, it can save elements of a subito search, and check if there are new items for the same query when checker is executed, price tracking hasn't been implemented yet. 

although detailed installation instructions will be provided later on, you can make it work by creating a folder "new_items" (without quotes) in the same subdirectory where you run Subito helper. To make it work at startup, you'll have to execute checker.py at boot, or make it so it is run automatically on boot.

As you can see, there is no error checking, since i'm sure everything will always go smoothly. just kidding, I'll have to do it sooner or later. the software is provided as is, i'm not liable for whatever you do with it, use it at your own risk
